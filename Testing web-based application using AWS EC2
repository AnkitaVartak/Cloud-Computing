For testing a new web-based application. The webserver must run on a Linux machine. It
must be configured as an Apache HTTP server, be cost effective and publicly
accessible.
For the webserver you will need to create and launch a t2.micro Amazon Elastic
Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instance using a free tier Linux Amazon Machine Image
(AMI). An AMI is a template used to create a virtual machine within Amazon EC2.
An Amazon EC2 instance provides scalable computing capacity in the Amazon Web
Services (AWS) Cloud. When you launch an Amazon EC2 instance, you are creating a
virtual server. This means you are securing space on a physical server located in an AWS
data center for your use. The allocated space consists of the compute, storage, and
network resources you need to run your webserver workload.
